# nodejs-getting-started

This repository contains some examples to help getting started with
NodeJS development.

The first example just runs the HTTP server included within the NodeJS
runtime on port http://localhost:3000.

The evolved one add a more scalable solution based on the Express
framework.

To resolve and install dependencies:

    npm install

To start the server just execute:

    npm start
